\section{Uni-Class Patterns}

\subsection{Implemented}
\begin{itemize}
\item Dead Class\ab{Why not Idle class?}: This uni-class pattern looks for all the classes that have not been changed for an X number of versions. Specifically, the uni-class pattern returns all the class versions in which this behavior occurs. For example, if a system has 10 versions and the class A was modified in versions 1, 4, and 10 the uni-class pattern will be true in the following versions whit X=3: 4, 7, 8, and 9.  
\item Most Complex Classes: This uni-class pattern looks for all the versions of the classes in which a class was in the X\% of the most complex classes of a system. To calculate the complexity of a class the metric Weighted Method Count (WMC) is used.   
\item Supernova: This uni-class pattern is related with the categorization proposed by Lanza. This milestone identifies those versions of a class in which it grows more than X\% regarding it previous version. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Not Implemented}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ghost Methods: A method that was deleted in a version is added again in a posterior version.
\item Duplicated Code: An index that measure the code duplication in a system increases a X\%  regarding it previous version.
\item Complex method: A method that is in the X\% of the most complex methods of a system was added.
\item Fan-In Indicator: A method has a fan-in higher than X.
\item Dead Method: A method with fan-in=0. \ab{I am not sure that a method with fan-in = 0 is a dead method. Imagine a method that simply return a value?}
\item \ab{fanoutCalls = average number of calls a method makes. Measure the amount of external calls a class/method does. }. 
\item Empty Method: This uni-class pattern looks for all the methods that are defined empty. This may be because they were defined to be implemented in the future\ab{In ArgoUML there are large classes with only empty methods}
\end{itemize}

\section{Multi-Class Patterns}
\ab{I do not really understand this section and the figure. Pick a simple example. For example, the evolution of the amount of used classes per class. }
\ab{Things that could be interesting to verify, is there a correlation between an increase of the cyclomatic complexity and the amount of dependent classes? My gut feeling says that a class that has an increase of the complexity cyclomatic has also an increase of the amount of dependent classes.}

\subsection{The pattern algorithm}
A multi-class pattern is composed by at least two uni-class patterns that occur in the same component. This occurrences can exist in the same or different versions. In order to determine the total number of versions considered to define a multi-class pattern, the pattern algorithm uses a threshold value where \emph{threshold>=0}. 
Consider the model history of the components shown in Figure \ref{fig:exampleOfPatterns}. In this case the history of 6 components is shown where each of them has 7 versions. Also, in this case are used four uni-class patterns.  
\begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[bb=25bp 490bp 580bp 810bp,clip,scale=0.75]{patterns}
  \caption{Pattern Example}
  \label{fig:exampleOfPatterns}
\end{figure}

When the algorithm is run using the proposed model history, it will return as its output a set of multi-class pattern. For example if the algorithm is run with threshold=0, then all the pattern will be composed by uni-class patterns that occur in a same version. In this case the patterns obtained will be: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \{[Yellow, v2], [Green, v2], C1\}
\item \{[Yellow, v7], [Green, v7], C2 \}
\item \{[Red, v3], [Green, v3], [Blue, v3], C4\}
\end{itemize}

If the algorithm is executed with  threshold=1, the output will be the patterns found when the algorithm was run with threshold=0 plus:
\begin{itemize}
\item \{[Red, v1], [Yellow, v2], [Green, v2], C1\}
\item \{[Blue, v5], [Green, v6], [Yellow, v7], [Green, v7], C2\}
\end{itemize}

Finally, if threshold=2, the returned patterns will be the same of threshold=0 and threshold=1 plus:
\begin{itemize}
\item \{[Red, v3], [Green, v3], [Blue, v3], [Yellow, v5], C4\}
\end{itemize}
